Attempted proof of concept

This code is meant to demonstrate proof of concept for offloading the cognitive burden of reasoning from LLMs to probablistic programs. Running the Python code shows GPT-3.5 often struggling to correctly answer deductive reasoning questions from bAbI task 1 (from bAbI tasks downloaded from Kaggle) incorrectly claiming that the location of some people is unknown or there is not enough information to determine it.
